Vietnamese lawmakers say they worry about becoming too dependent on China for loans and credit.

On national TV on Tuesday, a lawmaker said he worries that Vietnam’s independence will be threatened by money and investment from China.

It is unusual for Vietnamese officials to confront Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in public.

China recently offered $200-million in credit over five years to one of Vietnam’s largest banks. China is also a major investor in a $400-million elevated railway project in Hanoi.

Another lawmaker wanted to know how Vietnam will respond to China’s moves to acquire land in the South China Sea.

The U.S. has offered Vietnam $40-million in aid for security in the South China Sea. This funding comes as China tries to expand its sea territory.

Vietnam and the Philippines also signed a deal to cooperate in relation to the South China Sea.
